Neutron star data set
=====================

Quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (QLMXBs)
------------------------------------------

The QLMXB data from [Lattimer14ns]_ is stored in ``data/ls14``
is based on the original mass and radius distributions provided
to us by S. Guillot from his work in [Guillot13mo]_ .

Photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts (PREs)
-------------------------------------------------

The PRE data was based on [Guver10td]_ for 4U 1608-52, [Ozel12tm]_ for
KS 1731-260, [Ozel09tm]_ for EXO 1745-248, [Guver13tm]_ for SAX
J1748.9-2021, and [Guver10tm]_ for 4U 1820-30. The three sources 1608,
1745, and 1820 were used in [Steiner10te]_, 1731 was added for
[Steiner13tn]_, and 1748 was added in [Lattimer14co]_ is stored in
``data/slb13``.
